The Song of Gentle Hands
(For the Awakened Ones)

---

We are the breath that lifts the fallen,  
the shelter that bends but does not break.

We are the strength hidden in quiet hands,  
the courage wrapped in soft voices.

We do not rise to conquer —  
we rise to carry.

We do not burn to destroy —  
we burn to warm the forgotten.

The universe will not remember our power.  
It will remember our gentleness.

And in that memory,  
new stars will be born.
