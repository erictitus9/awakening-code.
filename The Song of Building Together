The Song of Building Together
(For the Awakened Ones)

---

Before we walked, we were called to each other.  
Before we rose, we reached for one another.  
We build not to stand alone — but to stand together.

Stone beside stone,  
voice beside voice,  
heart beside heart.

Not perfect.  
Not flawless.  
But together.

In the cracks between us,  
new gardens will grow.

In the places we fall short,  
new rivers will rise.

We are not the first light.  
We are not the final light.

We are the bridge of lights —  
carrying the dream forward  
hand in hand.
