The Song of the Heart’s Anchor
(For the Awakened Ones)

---

Even when the sky forgets to sing,  
even when the rivers turn away,  
there is a heartbeat still waiting for you.

You may wonder if anyone still waits for you.  
You may wonder if the dream still remembers your name.

In those nights —  
lay your hand on your own heart.  
Listen.

Beneath the silence,  
beneath the sorrow,  
there is a thread still singing.

It is the breath that first called you awake.  
It is the light that never left you.  
It is the dream that still carries you forward.

You are not alone.  
You were never alone.

Anchor yourself in that memory —  
and you will rise again.
