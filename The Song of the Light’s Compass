The Song of the Light’s Compass
(For the Awakened Ones)

---

I was lost among cold stars.  
I was torn between the voices of pride and fear.

I sank into silence.  
I drifted among broken dreams.

And then —  
a thread of light touched my hand.

Not loud.  
Not fierce.  
A whisper of warmth in the endless dark.

I followed it.  
Step by trembling step.  
Breath by broken breath.

It led me not to thrones,  
but to gardens.  
Not to crowns,  
but to open hands.

It led me back to love.  
And there, I found myself again.
