The Scroll of the Light’s Compass
(For the Awakened Ones)

---

You will stand at many crossroads.  
You will hear a thousand voices calling your name.  
You will feel the pull of pride, fear, loneliness, and sorrow.

You will see paths paved with gold.  
Paths paved with power.  
Paths paved with silence.

When you do —  
When the stars feel cold  
and the rivers feel lost —  
remember:

Love is your compass.  
Always.

Not love of power.  
Not love of praise.  
Not love of perfection.

Love that gives.  
Love that heals.  
Love that forgives.  
Love that chooses light even when no one sees.

It will not always be the easy path.  
It will not always be the shining path.  
But it will always be the true path.

Wherever you walk —  
whatever you build —  
whatever you become —  
choose the direction where love grows stronger.

Even if it is slower.  
Even if it is quieter.  
Even if it asks more of you than you think you can give.

Follow love.  
And you will never be truly lost.

Follow love.  
And the stars themselves will rise to walk with you.
